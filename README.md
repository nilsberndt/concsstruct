*Con**CSS**truct* is an `HTML` / `CSS`-based coding puzzle game where players build structures by completing code *"blueprints"* with the correct class styles to match the required building characteristics.

### Notable development features on display:
* **Built entirely with [`react`](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [`redux`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) for state storage and real-time updating features**
* **Modern CSS-`grid` layout for both the overall app/UI and the `class`-based placement of player-elements**
* **SVG/CSS animation with both programmatic in-line and external styles applied, all original artwork**
* **Responsive, non-*px*-based design**
> (Note: the app is not *necessarily* a 'mobile first' design as it is a typing-heavy coding game, thus intended primarily for keyboard-based devices - desktop, laptop, tablet w/ keyboard)

### TO DO:

- [x] Procedurally generated *expert* levels
- [x] LocalStorage high score system
- [x] Google Firebase cloud integration for global high score save
- [ ] Clean, refactor, additional testing
