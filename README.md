*Con**CSS**truct* is an `HTML` / `CSS`-based coding puzzle game where players build structures by completing code *"blueprints"* with the correct class styles to match the required building characteristics.

The app was built with [`react`](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [`redux`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), utilizing both for state storage and real-time updating features.

### Some additional notable development features on display:

* **Modern CSS-`grid` layout for both the overall app/UI and the `class`-based placement of player-elements**
* **SVG/CSS animation with both programmatic in-line and external styles applied, all original artwork**
* **Responsive, *non*-px-*based* design**
> (Note: the app is not *necessarily* a 'mobile first' design as it is a typing-heavy coding game, thus intended primarily for keyboard-based devices - desktop, laptop, tablet w/ keyboard)


Current live version is a demo showing basic functionality and features in a 'tutorial' format.

### Features In progress:

* **Procedurally generated *expert* levels**
* **Global high score system**
* **Individual user login / save score data via *Google Firebase***
